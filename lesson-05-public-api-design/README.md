## Designing a Public API

The goal of this lesson is to spend time thinking about how to design a public API.

### Intro

When you're designing a public API, especially a library, you really want to think about the end user.

Let's take a second to look at one example most of you are familiar with: Jest.

Let's look at the most basic example: assertions.

TODO@jsjoeio- use the `expect` and the `.toBe` as an example.

### Challenge

You have to completely redesign the API for the streak counter we're building. Come up with 5 examples of different APIs we could explore.

You don't have to know how they'll work under the hood. You only have to figure out what the end user would call to use it.

### Solution

Here are some I came up with
TODO@jsjoeio- come up with a couple different examples

### Extra Credit

Find 1 example of an open source project with an API you really like. Something that feels natural. Try to figure out why you like it and be prepared to share it with the group.
