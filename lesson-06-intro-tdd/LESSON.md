## Introduction to TDD

The goal of this lesson is to introduce you to Test-Driven-Development, or better known as TDD.

### Intro

TDD is a magical thing first coined by [famous person]).

The way that it works is you let tests drive your development.

That means instead of fixing a bug or writing a feature first, you start with the test. A very basic example:
1. write a test that makes sure current feature works
2. write a test for new feature
3. implement new feature

We're going to use that throughout our workshop today to build our library.

### Challenge

Using a TDD approach and this folder, write a very basic bowling game based on these requirements:

### Solution

Let's share solutions. Here is what I came up with.

### Extra Credit
