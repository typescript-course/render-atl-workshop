## Record a demo and add to your README

The goal of this lesson is to finalize our project by recording a demo and adding it to the `README.md`.

### Intro

This is the final piece! We really want our library to stick out so we're going to record a demo and add it the `README.md`.

There's nothing better than two things in a `README.md`:

- a video/gif with a visual demo
- a CodeSandbox to try the library online

### Challenge

Using your favorite tool of choice, record a video or gif and add it the `README.md` along with a CodeSandbox template link.

### Solution

Here is what my final version looks like.

### Extra Credit

Using a tool like Loom, record a 30-sec elevator pitch for your library.
