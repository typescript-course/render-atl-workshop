# Title

The goal of this lesson is stop and reflect on our TDD experience thus far.

## Intro

TDD can take quite a bit of time to adjust to and it doesn't always feel productive. For instance, if you're building a brand new UI, it might feel tedious to write tests first rather than just code it up.

Now that we've done it a little bit, let's discuss in our small groups then discuss as a whole group.

### Challenge

With the folks at your table, discuss the following:

- How has it been so far? What do you like/dislike about TDD?
- How does it affect the way you think about approaching problems?

### Solution

No specific solutions here. Instead, we'll take turns sharing what our group thought.

### Extra Credit

If you have extra time, discuss this question:

- Is this something you think you'll use moving forward? Why or why not?
- Should TDD be used when teaching new languages and tools?
