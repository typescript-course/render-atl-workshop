# Title

The goal of this lesson is to write the logic to reset the streak.

## Intro

If you recall our flow chart, one of the paths leads to a reset of the streak. This is when the user breaks their streak.

We'll need to add this logic so that streaks are reset properly.

### Challenge

Using TDD, write a function to reset the streak.

### Solution

Here is what I came up with.

### Extra Credit

Imagine you're explaining these to a new TS dev who knows JS well:

- What is the `Partial` utility type?
- What's another example where you might use it?
- What other built-in utlity types exist?
