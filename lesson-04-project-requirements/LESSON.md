## Writing Project Requirements in a Flow Chart

The goal of this lesson is to practice writing project requirements and create a flow chart for our library.

### Intro

Most of you are probably familiar with project requirements. Borrowing from that concept, we're going to talk about creating a flow chart to explain the logic of our library.

We're going to practice this by drawing our own flow chart to show how our library will work.

### Challenge

Your challenge for this lesson is to use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), to create a flow chart explaining how the logic will work in your library. Here are some events you may want to account for as part of your chart:

- Start of flow: your library is called
- Check if streak exists
- Initialize, update or reset streak

And here is an example for inspiration: https://excalidraw.com/#json=0mtnl6904HNaeT6ELf6T8,s_uKtfNN1ibsrdmmgbrMZA

Good luck!

### Solution

After you're done, compare your flow chart with mine here: https://excalidraw.com/#json=TtDzj3A2lfi_XAslXJ8C3,yLjp4lmK4Pug8lE4l4Uvzg

### Extra Credit

If you finish early and want an extra challenge, here are two things you can do:

1. Add colors and make your flow chart look fancy
2. Explain your flow chart to someone in your group
