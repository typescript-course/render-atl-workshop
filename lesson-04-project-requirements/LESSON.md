## Writing Project Requirements in a Flow Chart

The goal of this lesson is to practice writing project requirements and creating a flow chart for our library.

### Intro

Most of you are probably familiar with project requirements. Borrowing from that concept, we're going to talk about creating a flow chart to explain how the logic of our library will work.

We're going to practice this by drawing our own flow chart to show how our library will work.

### Challenge

Your challenge for this lesson is to use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), to create a flow chart explaining how the logic will work in your library. Some things you may want to account for:

- start of flow: your library is called
- checking if streak exists
- initialize, update or reset streak

Good luck!

### Extra Credit

If you finish early and want an extra challenge, here are two things you can do:

1. Add colors and make your flow chart look fancy
2. Explain your flow chart to someone in your group
