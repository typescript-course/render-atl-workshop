## Title

The goal of this lesson is to practice writing project requirements and creating a flow chart for our library.

### Intro

Depending on the size of your organization and your role, you may or may not write project requirements. It can be helpful for planning libraries and APIs if you do it yourself.

We're going to practice this by drawing our own flow chart to show how our library will work.

### Challenge

Your challenge for this lesson is to use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), to create a flow chart explaining how the logic will work in your library.

### Solution

After you're done, compare yours with mine here:

### Extra Credit

If you finish early and want an extra challenge, here are two things you can do: 1. Add colors and make your flow chart look fancy 2. Working with someone in your group, take turns explaining your flow chart
