## Creating a React App

The goal of this lesson is to use our published library in production by adding it to a React app.

### Intro

Now that our code is finally out there, it's time to actually use it in production!

We'll use CodeSandbox to iterate quickly and test this baby out.

### Challenge

Using this [CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/streak-counter-template-ts-course-tlfxfr?file=/src/App.tsx), add your streak counter library to the project and show the streak in the UI.

### Solution

Here is what mine looks like: https://codesandbox.io/s/streak-counter-solution-8bj1wc?file=/src/App.tsx

### Extra Credit

Try adding some extra spice to the UI with a CSS library like Tailwind. Or try showing different UIs depending on the streak.
