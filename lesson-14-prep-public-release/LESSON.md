# Title

The goal of this lesson is prep our code for a public release.

## Intro

When you're publishing code to the outside world for them to consume, there are certain things you should do first. For example, you should make your types available so folks get intellisense benefits. You should also not publish your test code with your package.

We'll also talk about mistakes to avoid, and tips for success.

// how to expose types
// reminder about exporting...

### Challenge

Using `microbundle`, prep your package by doing the following:

1. something
2. something

// package.json
// edit readme
// jest.config.cjs?
// npmignore

### Solution

Here is what it should look like after.

### Extra Credit

One things you might care about as a library author is usage stats. How many people are downloading your package a week? How many stars do you have? etc.

Come up with a list of usage metrics library authors might care about and figure out how you would get them.
