What project are you working on right now?

What's one thing most people don't know about you?


# Notes

API design lesson - some people confused on prompt (confused on how the Jest example relates to challenge). maybe give example and say "what would you see on the website? what method would we tell them to use to get started"

Lesson 4 example for challenge: https://excalidraw.com/#json=0mtnl6904HNaeT6ELf6T8,s_uKtfNN1ibsrdmmgbrMZA

Exacalidraw lesson - tell people that it will reset if they load from a URL. So save first...

Pace feels good. Sometimes people finish early. Not a ton of people doing extra credit AFAIK but that's okay! Having tables in groups has encouraged people to chat more which is great...
