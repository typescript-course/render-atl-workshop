## Ice breakers 

Where are you from and where do you work?

What project are you working on right now?

What's one thing most people don't know about you?


# Notes

API design lesson - some people confused on prompt (confused on how the Jest example relates to challenge). maybe give example and say "what would you see on the website? what method would we tell them to use to get started"

Lesson 4 example for challenge: https://excalidraw.com/#json=0mtnl6904HNaeT6ELf6T8,s_uKtfNN1ibsrdmmgbrMZA

Exacalidraw lesson - tell people that it will reset if they load from a URL. So save first...

Pace feels good. Sometimes people finish early. Not a ton of people doing extra credit AFAIK but that's okay! Having tables in groups has encouraged people to chat more which is great...

for lesson 5, explain how to init with npm/yarn `npm` or `yarn`

issues using `mkdir @jsjoeio/streak-counter` 
make sure to `cd` before initializing 
question about the convetions around `__tests__`

issues with TypeScript not finding Jest definitions (looking in root root). To fix, you have to open 

missing still? make sure you have `tsconfig.json`

lesson 5 taking about 20-30mins (issues with npm/yarn, ts and github)


TDD lesson...might want to slim down. Kinda overwhelming having to write that many tests. Might be better to do 1-2...

for the initialize streak lesson, fill out the tests for them. too much work writing tests AND writing code...

initialize streak...we're not using storage. why?

a bunch of issues because we forgot to create `tsconfig.json`

lesson 8 question "should we be overwriting previous tests?"

other issues, forgetting to create `tsconfig.json` or forgetting to install `@types/jsom`

TDD lessons are taking more than 10mins each...

questions about `localStorage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage

double check that all the gists are updated (I know I updated a few)

question about string literal vs enums...which to use?

increment streak - going over 10mins
also issue with test? not pasing in "12/12/2021" to `new Date()` call

Update extra credit in reset streak - don't mention Partial utility

question "are functions that aren't exported, are they private?" came up during the clean up lesson 12

didn't really have time for extra credit...

what would you like to know more about?
more about partial types
migrating a non-TS codebase -> to TS.

lesson 14 needs updates.

tell people to commit and push up as they're going...

15 took longer than 10 mins
