# Title

The goal of this lesson is to write the logic to increment our streak.

## Intro

Remember our flow chart? Well in this lesson we need to add the logic that will increment our streak.

We first need to think about what logic we'll use to determine if an increment is the right move. Then we'll need logic to actually increment the streak and keep track of it.

TODO - talk about when we should increment streak

TODO@jsjoeio- talk about string literals

### Challenge

Using TDD, complete these tests by making the appropriate changes to your `streakCounter` function:

// test for incrementing streak
// test for saving incremented streak to localStorage

### Solution

Here is the solution I came up with: TODO@jsjoeio - add link to gist

### Extra Credit

Imagine you're explaining this to a new JS developer learning TypeScript:

- what are string literal types?
- what are examples of ways you might use them?
