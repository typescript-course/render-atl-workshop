# Title

The goal of this lesson is write the logic that gets the streak if it already exists.

## Intro

In the previous lesson, we covered intializing the streak. What if it already exists though?

Well, that's what this challenge is for! We need to get the streak if it's been initialized, otherwise initialize a fresh one.

TODO@jsjoeio - mention something about TS conepts learning (type casting with JSON, getting data from localStorage)

### Challenge

Using TDD, write a function that gets the streak from localStorage and returns it.

### Solution

Here is how I tackled it.

### Extra Credit

For extra credit, consider these questions:

1. What are the downsides to storing in `localStorage`?
2. How would you adapt this to be able to use a database instead of `localStorage`?
