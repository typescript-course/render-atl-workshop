## Readme Driven Development

The goal of this lesson is to discussion Readme Driven Development so that we can use it in our project.

### Intro

Readme Driven Development or RDD for short, is a type of development where you write your `README.md` before any code or tests.

I first heard about this [here](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) from GitHub cofounder Tom Preston-Warner.

This is a great approach to use when building a library or API that others will consume. It forces you to consider the end user first. What would the ideal API look like? How would you use it? These are things we're going to explore with this challenge.

### Challenge

Similar to Duolingo, we're building a streak counter library. With only that piece of information, write a `README.md` for this library (NOTE: use the blank `README.md` in this folder).

### Solution

Nice work! There is no one correct answer but here is what mine looks like: https://gist.github.com/jsjoeio/e4d5ab11d900ab6a4377772ace0af128

We'll discuss as a group after the challenge.

### Extra Credit

Looking for an extra challenge? Spice up your `README.md` with something a little fancier. Maybe a table of contents? Maybe a logo? Here are a couple examples to give you some inspiration:
