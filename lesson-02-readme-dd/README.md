## README-Driven-Development

The goal of this lesson is to discussion README-Driven-Development so that we can use it in our project.

### Intro

README-Driven-Development or RDD for short, is a type of development where you think about how the user will see your project by first looking at the `README.md`.

This is a great approach to use when building a library or API that others will consume. It forces you to consider the end user first. What would the ideal API look like? How would you use it? These are things we're going to explore with this challenge.

### Challenge

In this folder, create a new file called `readme-challenge.md`. - tell them what weâ€™re building - use RDD

### Solution

Nice work! There are various answers to this challenge. Here is what mine looks like:

TODO@jsjoeio - add final `README.md` here.

### Extra Credit

Looking for an extra challenge? Spice up your `README.md` with something a little fancier. Maybe a table of contents? Maybe a logo? Here are a couple examples to give you some inspiration:
TODO@jsjoeio - add resources for readme templates and great examples.
