# Title

The goal of this lesson is publish our code on npm as a package.

## Intro

We have our library. It's tested and ready for public release. Now, how do we actually get it out there?

That's what this challenge is all about.

One thing to know about the npm/JS/TS world is package registries. These are places that host your code so others can download them.

The two most popular ones are npm and GitHub. npm is significantly more popular so we'll be using that.

### Challenge

1. sign up for an npm account (free)
2. add your token to your repo secrets
3. publish with github action

### Solution
