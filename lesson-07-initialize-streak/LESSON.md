# Title

The goal of this lesson is to write the logic to handle initializing a streak.

## Intro

Referencing our flow diagram, one of the parts of the flow is initializing the streak. This happens when there is no streak already.

One of the first TypeScript concepts we're going to discuss is Parameter Type Annotations. These are one of the most common and frequently used. This is when you annotate function parameters.

### Challenge

Using TDD write a function that passes these tests:

TODO@jsjoeio - add these tests

HINTS:
- give them a `src/index.ts`
- and a `__tests__/index.test.ts` 
this will get them going
add hint about mocking local storage

### Solution

Here is what mine looks like.

### Extra Credit

Imagine you're talking to a new JavaScript developer learning TypeScript. How would you explain _parameter type annotations_?
